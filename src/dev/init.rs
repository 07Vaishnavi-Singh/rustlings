Welcome to these third-party Rustlings exercises ðŸ˜ƒ

First,
[install Rustlings using the official instructions in the README of the Rustlings project](https://github.com/rust-lang/rustlings) âœ…

Then, open your terminal in this directory and run `rustlings` to get started with the exercises ðŸš€

const INIT_DONE: &str = r#"Initialization done!
You can start developing third-party Rustlings exercises in the `rustlings` directory :D

If the initialization was done in a Rust project which is a Cargo workspace, you need to add the
path to the `rustlings` directory to the `workspace.exclude` list in the project's `Cargo.toml`
file. For example:

[workspace]
exclude = ["rustlings"]"#;
